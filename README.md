This is a very simple program for pixel art written with the processing program https://processing.org
With this you can draw simple pixel art with the following keyboard commands:
q = increase Hue (0-360 it loops)
a = decrease Hue
w = increase Saturation (0-100 doesn't loop)
s = decrease Saturation
e = increase Value (0-100 doesn't loop)
h or left = cursor left (loops)
l or right = cursor right (loops)
k or up = cursor up (loops)
j or down =cursor down (loops)
0 = cursor to origin
8 = cusorX to zero
9 = cursorY to zero
p = current cursor is drawn to canvas
P = cursor is drawn to canvas until untoggled
backspace = reset canvas
enter/return = save to screenshot in current folder as .png
mouseDrag=cursor is moved and drawn to canvas under mouse

background is set to ugly pink so it can easily be pulled out of gimp2 to transparency

if all goes well Java is imbedded and just download the .exe or .linux and it'll work
